# Prompt_Engineer_Challenge
Test out your ability as an AI prompt engineer to implemnt wind turbine fault monitoring!

Download the .zip file, upload it to ChatGPT and ask GPT to attempt to assess the health of your turbine! 

hint: There is a generator failure that occurs during the testing set, use the training set to give GPT some context or dont...  

# Results (draft)
Basic:
1. Does the AI detect the fault in time with the installed system?
2. Does the AI detect the fault BEFORE the installed system?
Technical:
1. Would you, as a technician/engineer trust the results the AI gave you?
2. Would you, as a technician/engineer trust the results shown by the method NBM method? (NBM-based: Model which estimates healthy behaviour, then measure of fault is difference between true and estaimted) 

# Anomaly Detection Visualization

This project demonstrates how to visualize anomaly detection results from:
- A Linear Regression (LR) model
- A GPT-based Isolation Forest

The notebook highlights:
- Detected anomalies
- The failure alarm time
- Training and test periods
